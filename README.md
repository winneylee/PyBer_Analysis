# PyBer_Analysis

### Purpose of the analysis

The main purpose of this analysis is to use Python skills and knowledge of Pandas to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, youâ€™ll create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type to summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

From image above, we can see total rides, total drivers, total fares, average per ride and average per driver in different area in the city. And we can also get an example of how many drivers are there in each type of area of each city.

Image above shows that there were much more total fare, in other work more driver and more travel from Jan 2019 to May 2019 in urban than suburban and rural. It indicate that people in urban tend to use more of the pyber service than any other type.

 From line and pie chart above, we can easily see that people in Boston tend to use the pyber service more in July, which hold up to 14.5% of all year.
 
 ### Summary
 
To sum up,accourding to the result of the analysis, there is a larger use of PyBer ridesharing in urban cities, and more drivers in urban cities than rural cities.
As a result, the majority of PyBer's revenue occurs in urban cities. Therefore, it is recommended to spread out the number of driver based on the number of user in urban, suburban and rural.
