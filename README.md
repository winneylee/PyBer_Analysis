# PyBer_Analysis

### Purpose of the analysis

The main purpose of this analysis is to use Python skills and knowledge of Pandas to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, youâ€™ll create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type to summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.
